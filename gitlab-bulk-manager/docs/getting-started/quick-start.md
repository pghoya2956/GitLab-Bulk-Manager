- Download example CSVs from the UI
- Modify them for your needs
- Keep templates for repeated tasks

### 3. Monitor Operations
- Always check the Jobs page
- Review logs for any failures
- Use the retry feature if needed

### 4. Backup First
- Export existing structure before major changes
- Keep CSV backups of your operations
- Document your bulk operations

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Can't Login?
- Verify your PAT has correct scopes
- Check GitLab URL (include https://)
- Ensure backend server is running

### Import Fails?
- Check CSV format matches exactly
- Verify group/project IDs exist
- Look for detailed errors in Jobs page

### Slow Performance?
- Reduce batch size to 50 items
